description: How The Coffee Can Camp earns money and why it doesn't change what we say.

## The Short Version

Some links on this site are affiliate links. If you click one and buy something, I earn a small commission — at no extra cost to you. It doesn't change the price you pay, and it doesn't change what I recommend.

## The Longer Version

The Coffee Can Camp is a participant in affiliate advertising programs including, but not limited to, the Impact affiliate network and other programs. These programs are designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by linking to products and retailers.

When you click an affiliate link and make a purchase, the retailer pays me a small percentage of the sale. This is how this site generates revenue.

**What this means for you:**

- You pay the same price you would pay going directly to the retailer
- I only recommend gear I would actually carry, use, or stake my comfort on
- Affiliate relationships do not influence my reviews or recommendations
- If something is junk, I'll say it's junk

## FTC Compliance

In accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising, I disclose that I have affiliate relationships with retailers linked on this site. Posts containing affiliate links are not sponsored posts unless explicitly stated.
