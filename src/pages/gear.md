Every gear recommendation on this site comes from the same place: understanding what *doesn't* work, because I've been there.

The cast iron skillet. The wet sleeping bag. The campfire that almost went out in a monsoon. The tent pitched on a slope that slowly filled with water.

That's the education. The recommendations below are the result of it.

## The Short Version of My Philosophy

**Carry less than you think you need.** The stuff that matters — shelter, sleep system, cook system, water — should be light enough that you barely notice it. Everything else is negotiable.

**Buy once, buy right.** A $40 piece of gear you replace every two seasons costs more than a $120 piece of gear that lasts ten years. This is the math that took me too long to learn.

**The best gear is gear you'll actually use.** The most sophisticated ultralight setup in the world is worthless if it's too complicated to set up at dark-thirty in the rain.

## Core Categories

### Sleep System
Your sleeping bag and sleeping pad are the most important investments you'll make. Everything else can be improvised. A bad night's sleep in the backcountry affects everything.

*More coming soon.*

### Shelter
Tent, hammock, tarp — the choice depends on where you're going and how you sleep. I'll break down all three.

*More coming soon.*

### Cook System
This is where I have the most opinions. See [The Cast Iron Skillet They Made Me Carry](/posts/cast-iron-skillet/) for the origin story.

*More coming soon.*

### Pack
Everything else goes in here. Getting the pack right is about fit more than features.

*More coming soon.*
